# GLSort
Visualises various sort algorithms using OpenGL. 

## History
Originally implemented in C ("glsort") and then ported to C++ ("glsort2") during my studies in the late 90ies - this is code archaeology, folks :)

It used "raw" OpenGL (2.x at best, I guess) and a GL utility library called GLUT:

Quote: "Download the GLUT 3.7 beta source distribution (shift Left in Netscape)" - oh dear, you know that you are knee-deep in history when a website still mentions "Netscape" ;)

## Plans
There are none. But perhaps the idea to:
- Make the code compile again (somehow)
- Port it to "modern C++" and 
- Perhaps use Qt as toolkit (I am sceptical about getting GLUT to work ;))
